It outputs 0 for negative inputs, and the input itself for positive ones. The function is non differentiable at x = 0, but the probability of the input being exactly 0 in a 16 or 32 bit float variable is almost non-existent, and the derivative can be hardcoded to be 0 or 1 at x = 0.\n","\n"," Sigmoid function squishes the input between 0 and 1, and so has a vanishing gradient problem. It's computationaly expensive as compared to ReLU, and should not be used for deep neural networks, except for gates in LSTM and GRU.\n","\n"," **6) Describe what one epoch actually is (epoch was a parameter used in the .fit() method).**\n","\n"," One epoch is passing the training data through the model once. For small learning rates, one pass through the data might not be enough for the optimizer to find the minima, which is why multiple epochs are needed to train the neural network.\n","\n"," **7) Explain how dropout works (you can look at the keras code and/or documentation) for (a) training, and (b) test data sets.**\n","\n"," For training data, dropout sets randomly chosen activations to 0 with a probability $p$. The activations not set to 0 are scaled up by a factor of $1/(1-p)$ to keep the sum over all inputs unchanged.\n","\n"," For test data, the dropout layer is inactive.\n","\n"," **8) Explain why problems such as this homework assignment are better modeled with RNNs than CNNs. What type of problem will CNNs outperform RNNs on?**\n","\n"," RNNs are better suited for sequences, as they remember dependencies in data. CNNs on the other hand work well for images, as the filters act over regions of data and extract information to create feature maps.\n","\n"," In this problem, each record is dependent on previous ones, making RNN the better choice. Although CNNs are specialized for image data, they can be used for sequences as well, and should be picked when optimizing for performance on high dimensional data, as CNNs are faster.\n","\n"," **9) Explain what RNN problem is solved using LSTM and briefly describe how.**\n","\n"," RNNs struggle with vanishing gradients when dealing with long term dependencies as the derivatives are multiplied several times over for longer sequences. LSTMs address with by maintaining a cell state alongside the hidden state, which acts as \"memory\" to remember long term interactions."]}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":3},"orig_nbformat":2},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
